## Core Business Workflows

Both products share four core workflows. Customer pain points and feature gaps exist across all four stages.

### 1. Event Creation & Setup
**What Happens:** Event organizers build their event page, configure ticketing, set up branding

**Key Actions:**
- Create event landing page with description, images, schedule
- Configure ticket types (free, paid, early bird, VIP tiers)
- Set up custom branding (logos, colors, email templates)
- Define event settings (time zone, capacity limits, waitlists)

**Common Pain Points:**
- Complex setup takes too long (especially for repeat events)
- Hard to clone/template previous events
- Limited customization options for branding
- Difficult to manage multi-session events (conferences with tracks)

---

### 2. Registration & Marketing
**What Happens:** Attendees discover the event, register, and receive communications

**Key Actions:**
- Attendees land on event page, browse details
- Fill out registration form (name, email, company, custom fields)
- Complete payment (if paid event)
- Receive confirmation email with calendar invite
- Get reminder emails leading up to event

**Common Pain Points:**
- High abandonment rates in registration flow (avg 40% drop-off at payment)
- Poor mobile registration experience
- Limited email personalization and automation
- No built-in promotional tools (discount codes, referral tracking)
- Hard to integrate with marketing automation platforms

---

### 3. Event Delivery
**What Happens:** The actual event takes place (in-person or virtual)

**Key Actions:**
- Attendee check-in (QR code scan or virtual login)
- Live event experience (sessions, networking, Q&A)
- Real-time engagement (polls, chat, reactions)
- Speaker/session management

**Common Pain Points:**
- Slow check-in process at large events (long lines)
- Poor virtual attendee engagement (people drop off quickly)
- Limited networking features (hard to connect with other attendees)
- Clunky speaker/session management for multi-track events
- Technical issues during live virtual events (buffering, audio problems)

---

### 4. Post-Event Analytics & Follow-Up
**What Happens:** Organizers analyze event success and nurture attendee relationships

**Key Actions:**
- View attendance reports (who showed up, no-shows, drop-off rates)
- Analyze engagement metrics (session views, poll responses, Q&A activity)
- Export attendee data for sales/marketing follow-up
- Send post-event surveys and thank-you emails
- Measure ROI (ticket revenue, sponsor value, lead generation)

**Common Pain Points:**
- Analytics are surface-level (hard to get actionable insights)
- No automated follow-up workflows
- Difficult to measure event ROI and attribution to sales pipeline
- Can't easily segment attendees for targeted follow-up
- Post-event survey response rates are very low

---

## Current Market Context (Q1 2026)

**Competitive Pressure:**
- Cvent and Bizzabo are aggressively discounting to steal EventFlow Pro customers
- Zoom Events is bundling virtual events with Zoom licenses (threatening EventFlow Live)
- New entrants (Luma, Partiful) are winning younger, tech-savvy organizers

**Executive Priorities:**
- **CEO:** Protect enterprise base, hit $100M ARR by end of 2026
- **CRO:** Reduce mid-market churn, increase ACV through upsells
- **CPO:** Ship features that differentiate from Cvent, especially in analytics and automation

**Recent Escalations:**
- MegaCorp (Fortune 100 customer, $800K ACV) threatened to churn due to "lack of innovation"
- Top sales prospect (TechConf, potential $500K deal) chose Bizzabo because of better networking features
- SMB churn spiked 15% last quarter due to "too complicated" feedback

## Strategic Questions for R&D

Given the competitive landscape and customer feedback, which features should EventFlow prioritize to:
1. Protect and grow enterprise ARR (EventFlow Pro)?
2. Reduce churn and move upmarket with EventFlow Live?
3. Differentiate from competitors in a crowded market?

**The Challenge:** Sales, Engineering, and TPMs all have different perspectives on what's most urgent. Can you align on the optimal roadmap?
