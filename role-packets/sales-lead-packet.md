### TRANSCRIPT #1: MegaCorp Renewal Discussion

**Customer:** MegaCorp (Fortune 100 Financial Services)
**Current ACV:** $800,000/year
**Segment:** Enterprise - Key Account
**Date:** January 15, 2026, 11:00 AM ET
**Attendees:**
- Sarah Chen, VP of Corporate Events (MegaCorp)
- Tom Rodriguez, Account Executive (EventFlow)
- Lisa Park, Customer Success Manager (EventFlow)

**Context:** Annual renewal discussion. Contract expires March 31, 2026.

---

**Tom Rodriguez:** Sarah, thanks for making time today. I know you're busy planning the annual Leadership Summit. How's that going?

**Sarah Chen:** That's actually what I wanted to talk about, Tom. We're 8 weeks out from the conference and I'm getting a lot of pressure from our CIO about the mobile experience. Last year was... not great.

**Tom:** I remember we had some feedback about the mobile app. What specifically is the concern this year?

**Sarah:** It's not just feedback, Tom - it's become a strategic priority for us. We have 5,000 executives attending, and our CIO wants a fully branded mobile experience. Like what Cvent offers - a custom white-label app with our MegaCorp branding, offline mode for when Wi-Fi is spotty in the convention center, integration with our internal directory system.

**Lisa Park:** Sarah, I want to make sure I understand the requirements. When you say custom white-label app, are you thinking about a native iOS and Android app with full MegaCorp branding?

**Sarah:** Exactly. Our brand standards are very strict - we can't just slap our logo on a generic event app. We need custom colors, fonts, the whole brand experience. And it needs to work offline because, let's be honest, conference Wi-Fi is always terrible.

**Tom:** I hear you. That's a significant undertaking from a development standpoint. Can I ask - what's driving this as a priority? Is this coming from attendees or leadership?

**Sarah:** Both, honestly. Our CEO used our competitor's app at Dreamforce last year and was really impressed. And attendees have been complaining. But more importantly, Tom, this is a deal-breaker for renewal. Our CIO has already started conversations with Cvent about their custom app solution.

**Tom:** [pause] Okay, that's... that's important for us to understand. When you say deal-breaker-

**Sarah:** I mean we're not renewing in March unless we have a path forward on this. I'm not trying to be difficult, but I've got executive pressure and Cvent is being very aggressive on pricing. They've offered us a custom app as part of their enterprise package.

**Lisa:** Sarah, I want to make sure we explore all options here. EventFlow's mobile web experience has improved a lot in the last six months. Have you had a chance to test the responsive design updates?

**Sarah:** Lisa, I appreciate that, but mobile web isn't what we need. We need an app in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store with MegaCorp branding. That's what leadership expects.

**Tom:** Understood. Let me take this back to our product team and see what's possible. I know custom app development is a big investment, but you're obviously a critical customer for us.

**Sarah:** I appreciate that, Tom. But I need to be honest - we're already talking to Cvent and they can deliver this. I like working with EventFlow, but I have a job to do. If we can't get this resolved by mid-February, we'll need to make a decision.

**Tom:** Mid-February, got it. Let me work on this and get back to you by end of week with a plan. Anything else on your mind for the summit?

**Sarah:** Well, since you're asking... [laughs] Our marketing team tried to register for a test event last week to QA the flow, and three of them gave up halfway through on their phones. I don't know what happened, but they said the form was clunky and the payment screen didn't work right on mobile. That's concerning with 5,000 people registering.

**Tom:** Hmm, I haven't heard that feedback before. Lisa, have we seen support tickets on mobile registration issues?

**Lisa:** I'd have to check, but I don't think it's been flagged as a widespread problem. Sarah, was this on iOS or Android?

**Sarah:** iOS, I think? I didn't get all the details. They just told me it was frustrating and they ended up switching to their laptops. But honestly, that's a nice-to-have fix - the custom app is the critical thing.

**Tom:** Right, absolutely. The app is priority one. I'll follow up on the registration thing separately.

**Sarah:** Actually, one more thing while I have you both. This is our 5th year running this conference with EventFlow. Every year we start from scratch building the event page, setting up the schedule, configuring everything. Is there any way to just... copy last year's event and update the dates? That would save my team probably 10-15 hours.

**Lisa:** That's interesting feedback. I know some customers have asked for event templates before. We don't have that feature today, but I can pass that along to product.

**Sarah:** Yeah, it's not urgent, but would be nice. Anyway, back to the main issue - I really need that custom app, Tom. $800K renewal is on the line here.

**Tom:** Message received loud and clear, Sarah. Let me talk to our product and engineering teams and I'll get back to you by Friday with a proposal. I really appreciate your candor about the Cvent conversations - helps us understand the urgency.

**Sarah:** Of course. I hope we can make this work. We've been happy with EventFlow overall, but this is non-negotiable for us this year.

**Tom:** Understood. Talk Friday.

**[Call ends]**

---

**Tom's Internal Notes:**
- URGENT: $800K renewal at risk if we don't deliver custom mobile app
- CIO-level pressure, already talking to Cvent
- Deadline: Mid-February for decision
- Secondary issues: mobile registration experience (3 people gave up), event cloning/templates (nice-to-have)
- Need to loop in product team ASAP

### TRANSCRIPT #2: TechConf Post-Mortem (Lost Deal)

**Prospect:** TechConf (Annual Developer Conference Organizer)
**Deal Size:** $500,000 ACV (3-year contract)
**Segment:** Mid-Market
**Date:** December 18, 2025, 2:00 PM PT
**Attendees:**
- Kevin Walsh, CEO & Founder (TechConf)
- Amanda Foster, Account Executive (EventFlow)
- Mark Chen, Sales Engineer (EventFlow)

**Context:** Kevin has decided to go with Bizzabo after 6-week evaluation. This is a post-mortem call to understand why we lost.

---

**Amanda Foster:** Kevin, first of all, thank you for taking the time to give us feedback. I know you've probably been through the wringer with demos and evaluations. We really appreciate you being willing to chat even though you've made your decision.

**Kevin Walsh:** Of course, Amanda. I want to be helpful because you guys were great to work with. This was a tough decision - you were our second choice.

**Mark Chen:** That's good to hear, at least. Can you walk us through what ultimately tipped the scales toward Bizzabo?

**Kevin:** Sure. So, context: TechConf is a 3-day developer conference with about 2,000 attendees. We have 80 speakers across 6 tracks, lots of networking events, sponsor booths, the whole thing. Networking is absolutely core to the experience - people come to TechConf to meet other developers, potential employers, investors, etc.

**Amanda:** Right, I remember you emphasized that in our first call.

**Kevin:** Yeah, so when we were comparing EventFlow and Bizzabo, the networking features were a major differentiator. Bizzabo has this AI-powered matchmaking where attendees fill out their interests and job roles, and the system suggests people they should meet. They also have a 1:1 meeting scheduler built in where people can book 15-minute coffee chats, and it syncs with their Google Calendar.

**Mark:** We do have some networking features - attendees can view each other's profiles, there's a discussion board, direct messaging...

**Kevin:** I know, Mark, and those are fine. But they're pretty basic. With Bizzabo's AI matchmaking, attendees get push notifications like "You should meet Jane - you both work in ML infrastructure." That's powerful for a conference where networking is the main value prop.

**Amanda:** That makes sense. Were there other factors or was networking the primary driver?

**Kevin:** Networking was the biggest thing, but there were a few smaller issues. Honestly, Amanda, your registration flow on mobile was pretty clunky compared to Bizzabo's. I tested both on my phone and Bizzabo's was much smoother - fewer form fields, payment was easier. I didn't think much of it at first, but then I realized 65% of our registrations come from mobile, especially the younger developers. So that matters.

**Mark:** Interesting. I hadn't realized mobile was such a high percentage of your traffic.

**Kevin:** Yeah, most developer conferences see high mobile registration because people are browsing Twitter or Reddit on their phones, see the conference announcement, and register right away. If the mobile experience is friction-y, you lose them.

**Amanda:** That's really valuable feedback. Anything else that influenced the decision?

**Kevin:** Hmm, let me think. Oh, one thing that would have been nice - I spent like 3 hours setting up the event page, schedule, speaker bios, all of that. With Bizzabo, I could just clone last year's TechConf event and update the speakers and dates. That would have saved me a ton of time. You guys didn't have that feature.

**Mark:** Event cloning is on our roadmap, but you're right, we don't have it today. Was that a major factor?

**Kevin:** Not major, but it contributed to the overall impression that Bizzabo was more polished and mature. Like, I'm running the same conference every year with minor tweaks - why am I rebuilding everything from scratch?

**Amanda:** Totally fair. Kevin, if we had the networking features, would that have changed your decision?

**Kevin:** Hard to say for sure, but probably yes. The networking piece was the main gap. Everything else was pretty comparable - your pricing was actually a bit better than Bizzabo's. But for TechConf, networking features are table stakes.

**Mark:** Got it. This is super helpful, Kevin. One last question - do you think the networking features are important for all types of events, or specifically for conferences like TechConf?

**Kevin:** Good question. I think it's really important for multi-day conferences where networking is a primary goal. If I were running, like, a webinar series or a single-day workshop, I probably wouldn't care as much. But for TechConf, it's essential.

**Amanda:** That makes sense. Well, Kevin, thank you for the honesty. We're going to take this feedback back to our product team. Even though we didn't win this deal, I hope we can stay in touch. Maybe we'll have a chance to work together in the future.

**Kevin:** Absolutely. And hey, if you guys build out those networking features, let me know. I'm committed to Bizzabo for the next year, but we evaluate vendors annually.

**Amanda:** Will do. Thanks again, Kevin.

**[Call ends]**

---

**Amanda's Internal Notes:**
- Lost $500K deal primarily due to networking features (AI matchmaking, meeting scheduler)
- Kevin emphasized networking is core to TechConf's value proposition
- Secondary issues: Mobile registration was "clunky" (65% of his registrations are mobile), lack of event cloning (spent 3 hours on manual setup)
- Pricing was competitive - this was a product gap, not a pricing issue
- Note: Kevin said networking is critical for conferences, less important for webinars/workshops
- Opportunity to re-engage if we build networking features

### TRANSCRIPT #3: InnovateCorp Expansion Opportunity

**Customer:** InnovateCorp (SaaS Marketing Platform)
**Current ACV:** $150,000/year (20 events/year)
**Expansion Opportunity:** $400,000/year (60 events/year)
**Segment:** Mid-Market
**Date:** February 5, 2026, 10:00 AM PT
**Attendees:**
- David Park, Chief Marketing Officer (InnovateCorp)
- Rachel Kim, Account Executive (EventFlow)

**Context:** InnovateCorp is scaling their webinar program from 20 to 60 events per year. This is a major expansion opportunity.

---

**Rachel Kim:** David, congratulations on the funding round! I saw the TechCrunch article. Series C, $80 million - that's huge.

**David Park:** Thank you! Yeah, we're excited. It's going to let us scale the marketing team significantly. That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.

**Rachel:** I figured this was related. What's the plan?

**David:** So, we're currently doing about 20 webinars a year - mostly demand gen and product education. With the new funding, we're scaling to 60 webinars per year. We're hiring three more content marketers, and each person will run a weekly webinar series.

**Rachel:** That's incredible growth. 60 webinars is a serious operation.

**David:** Yeah, which is why I'm thinking about our event platform strategy. EventFlow has been great for our current needs, but I need to make sure we have the right tools to scale 3x.

**Rachel:** Absolutely. What are your biggest concerns about scaling?

**David:** Well, first question - can EventFlow handle 60 events per year from a technical standpoint? I don't want to hit any limits.

**Rachel:** Definitely. We have customers running hundreds of events per year on EventFlow. That's not a problem at all from a capacity perspective.

**David:** Good, good. The other thing is... okay, so our current process is that our content marketer spends like 2-3 hours setting up each webinar event page, writing the description, setting up emails, configuring everything. If we're doing 60 events a year, that's 120-180 hours of just event setup. That's basically a full-time job.

**Rachel:** Right, that's a lot of operational overhead.

**David:** Exactly. So I've been looking at what features could help us streamline this. One thing I'm seeing from your competitors - Zoom Events, Luma, even Eventbrite - is AI-powered content generation. Like, the AI writes your session description, your promotional emails, social posts, all of that. You just give it some bullet points and it generates the content.

**Rachel:** That's interesting. Is that something you'd use?

**David:** I mean, it sounds appealing. We run the same webinar format every week - "Best Practices for [Topic]" - so it's pretty templated. If AI could generate the copy, that could save a ton of time. Plus, it's good for positioning. My CEO keeps asking if we're using "AI-forward" tools.

**Rachel:** [laughs] Every CEO is asking that these days. What else are you looking for?

**David:** Well, another thing - and this might be more realistic than AI - is just... can we template the webinars? Like, we're running the same format every week. Can I set up a template once with all the settings, branding, email sequence, everything, and then just duplicate it each week and change the title and date?

**Rachel:** That's a really good question. We don't have a formal template or cloning feature today. You'd need to set up each webinar individually.

**David:** Ugh, that's what I was afraid of. That's a lot of manual work for my team. I know Zoom Events has something like this - you can save a webinar as a template and reuse it.

**Rachel:** I hear you. Let me take that back to product as feedback. That seems like a pretty common need for customers running high-frequency events like you.

**David:** Yeah, I'd love that. I mean, between templating and AI generation, I'd probably take templating first. That's a concrete time-saver. The AI thing is more of a "nice to have" - I'd want to make sure the AI understands our brand voice. We're pretty particular about our messaging.

**Rachel:** Makes sense. What else is on your wishlist?

**David:** Okay, last thing - and this is more strategic. I need to prove ROI to my CFO. We're spending $150K on EventFlow, and if we go to $400K, I need to show that these webinars are actually driving pipeline. Right now, your analytics are pretty basic - I can see how many people attended, but I can't really show the full picture of engagement and impact.

**Rachel:** What kind of analytics would be helpful?

**David:** I want to see things like engagement scores for each attendee - who was actually paying attention vs. who was multitasking. I want to track the journey from registration to attendance to follow-up. I want an ROI calculator that shows how many opportunities came from webinars. Basically, I need to prove to my CFO that webinars are worth the investment.

**Rachel:** That's really valuable feedback. I know our analytics are somewhat limited today. Is that a blocker for the expansion, or more of a nice-to-have?

**David:** It's not a blocker for the next six months, but it will be long-term. My CFO is already asking questions like "Why are we spending $150K on webinars?" If I'm going to ask for $400K, I need better data to justify it. Otherwise, she'll tell me to just use Zoom webinars for free.

**Rachel:** Totally understand. Let me summarize what I'm hearing: event templating is the biggest operational need for scaling, better analytics are critical for proving ROI long-term, and AI content generation is a nice-to-have but not essential. Is that right?

**David:** Yeah, that's about right. Oh, and the AI stuff matters for perception too. Like I said, my CEO keeps asking if we're investing in AI tools. It's kind of a checkbox for him - he wants to feel like we're using cutting-edge tech.

**Rachel:** Got it. So AI has strategic value even if the practical value is uncertain.

**David:** Exactly. It's good for board slides. [laughs]

**Rachel:** [laughs] I understand completely. Okay, David, let me take this back to our team. We definitely want to support your expansion. Let me see what I can find out about roadmap for templating, AI, and analytics.

**David:** Sounds good. One more thing - when you talk to your product team, can you ask them about the AI roadmap specifically? I'm getting pressure from my CEO to make sure we're investing in "AI-forward" platforms. I need to be able to tell him EventFlow has AI capabilities.

**Rachel:** Absolutely. I'll ask about that specifically and get back to you next week.

**David:** Perfect. Thanks, Rachel.

**[Call ends]**

---

**Rachel's Internal Notes:**
- $150K → $400K expansion opportunity (3x growth)
- Scaling from 20 to 60 webinars/year
- Biggest operational need: Event templating/cloning (saves 120-180 hours/year of manual setup)
- Strategic need: Better analytics to prove ROI to CFO (engagement scores, attendee journey, ROI calculator)
- AI content generation: Nice-to-have, but mostly for perception/positioning with CEO ("AI-forward" checkbox)
- Note: David said templating > AI for practical value, but AI matters for strategic positioning
- Timeline: Not urgent blocker, but needs to be on roadmap for long-term expansion

## Section 2: Executive Escalations & Competitive Loss Reports

### EMAIL #1: CEO Escalation - MegaCorp

```
From: Jennifer Wu, CEO
To: Sales Team, Product Team
Date: January 16, 2026, 4:47 PM
Subject: URGENT: MegaCorp Renewal at Risk

Team -

I just got off the phone with MegaCorp's CIO, Robert Chen. This is a critical situation.

MegaCorp is our largest enterprise customer at $800K ARR - that's roughly 10% of our total enterprise revenue. Robert told me in no uncertain terms that they are evaluating Cvent because we don't have a custom white-label mobile app solution for their annual Leadership Summit.

This is not a negotiation tactic. They are seriously considering switching platforms after 5 years with us. Robert said their CEO was impressed by a competitor's branded mobile app at Dreamforce and now expects the same for MegaCorp's flagship event.

Losing MegaCorp would be devastating not just for the revenue, but for our enterprise positioning. They are a Fortune 100 reference customer and a logo we showcase in every enterprise sales pitch. If word gets out that they left us for Cvent, it will hurt our credibility with other large accounts.

I need Product and Engineering to tell me: Can we deliver a custom mobile app solution for MegaCorp's conference in March? What would it take?

Tom is working directly with Sarah Chen (their VP of Events) and has until mid-February to present a solution, or they're moving to Cvent.

This is our top priority. Please treat it as such.

-Jennifer

### EMAIL #2: VP Sales - Lost TechConf Deal

```
From: Maria Rodriguez, VP Sales
To: Sales Team, Product Team
CC: Jennifer Wu, CEO
Date: December 19, 2025, 9:12 AM
Subject: Post-Mortem: Lost TechConf ($500K) to Bizzabo

Team -

This one stings. We lost the TechConf deal to Bizzabo - $500K ACV over 3 years.

I've reviewed Amanda's call notes and listened to the post-mortem recording. The primary reason we lost: networking features. Specifically, Bizzabo's AI-powered attendee matchmaking and 1:1 meeting scheduler.

Kevin Walsh (TechConf CEO) was crystal clear that networking is core to their conference value proposition. Attendees come to TechConf to meet other developers, employers, and investors. Bizzabo's AI matchmaking and meeting scheduler directly address that need. Our basic networking features (profiles, discussion boards, DMs) weren't competitive.

This is now the 4th competitive loss in Q4 where networking features came up as a differentiator:
- September: DevSummit chose Hopin (cited networking features)
- October: CloudConnect chose Bizzabo (cited meeting scheduler)
- November: DataConf chose Cvent (cited virtual networking lounges)
- December: TechConf chose Bizzabo (cited AI matchmaking + meeting scheduler)

I'm seeing a pattern here. Conference organizers - especially in the tech industry - are prioritizing networking capabilities, and we're falling behind Bizzabo and Cvent.

To be clear: This wasn't a pricing issue. Amanda said our pricing was actually better than Bizzabo's. This was a pure product gap.

Product team: What would it take to build competitive networking features? This is costing us deals in a market segment (conferences) where we want to grow.

Amanda and Mark - great work on this deal. You did everything right. We just don't have the product to compete in this space yet.

### EMAIL #3: Customer Follow-Up - AI Features

```
From: David Park, CMO
To: Rachel Kim, Account Executive
Date: February 6, 2026, 11:34 AM
Subject: Re: EventFlow Expansion - AI Roadmap Question

Rachel -

Thanks for the call yesterday. I really appreciate you taking the time to understand our needs as we scale the webinar program.

One follow-up question that I wanted to put in writing:

I'm seeing all of your competitors (Zoom Events, Luma, even Eventbrite) rolling out AI features for event management. Specifically:
- AI-powered content generation (session descriptions, emails, social posts)
- Smart attendee recommendations and matching
- Automated session summaries and insights

It feels like AI is becoming table stakes in the event tech space. Everyone is talking about "AI-first" platforms.

Here's my concern: I'm getting pressure from our CEO (and our board) to make sure we're investing in AI-forward tools across the company. We just hired a "Head of AI Strategy" who's auditing all our software vendors to make sure we're using modern, AI-enabled platforms.

I want to stick with EventFlow - you've been a great partner. But I need to be able to show that EventFlow has (or will have soon) AI capabilities. Otherwise, I'll be forced to evaluate other platforms that are positioning themselves as "AI-first."

Can you share EventFlow's AI roadmap? What AI features are you planning to ship in 2026?

I know this might sound like buzzword chasing, but it's real pressure from leadership. I need to be able to check the "AI" box when we're discussing our marketing tech stack.

Thanks for understanding.

Best,
David

## Your Talking Points for the Discussion

**What you're hearing from customers:**

1. **MegaCorp mobile app is URGENT**
   - $800K renewal at risk (10% of enterprise revenue)
   - CEO-level escalation from Jennifer
   - Deadline: Mid-February or they go to Cvent
   - This is our flagship enterprise customer - losing them would be devastating

2. **Networking features are costing us conference deals**
   - Lost TechConf ($500K) to Bizzabo because of networking
   - This is the 4th Q4 loss where networking came up
   - Conference organizers are prioritizing AI matchmaking and meeting schedulers
   - We're falling behind Bizzabo and Cvent in this segment

3. **AI features are becoming table stakes**
   - Prospects ask about AI in every demo
   - David Park is getting CEO/board pressure to use "AI-first" tools
   - All competitors (Zoom, Luma, Eventbrite) are shipping AI content generation
   - We need AI features for competitive positioning, even if practical value is uncertain

**What you want from this discussion:**

- Push for MegaCorp mobile app (F01) - this is non-negotiable from your perspective
- Advocate for networking features (F02) - this is a clear competitive gap
- Make the case for AI features (F03) - needed for positioning and perception

**Potential pushback you expect:**

- Engineering will say custom mobile app is too customer-specific and doesn't scale
- TPM might have data showing other features have broader impact
- Engineering might push back on AI as "unproven" or "trendy"

**What would make you change your mind:**

- If TPM has strong quantitative data showing different features have higher ARR impact
- If Engineering can propose an alternative solution for MegaCorp that doesn't require custom app
- If there's a way to balance urgent customer needs with broader strategic priorities

---

## Instructions for the Simulation

1. **Read the transcripts carefully** (10 min) - These represent real customer conversations with critical feedback

2. **Present your perspective** (5 min) - Share what you're hearing from customers and why certain features feel urgent

3. **Listen to Engineering and TPM** (10 min) - They may have different data or perspectives

4. **Advocate for customers** (15 min) - Your job is to represent what customers are telling you, but be open to data-driven reprioritization

5. **Fill out the worksheet** - Work with your team to select 5 features within 100 story points

---

**Remember:** You are the voice of the customer in this discussion. Your job is to make sure customer needs and competitive threats are heard. But you should also be open to data from TPM that might show broader opportunities you're not seeing from individual customer conversations.

Good luck!
