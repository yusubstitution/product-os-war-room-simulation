# TPM Packet - Q1 2026 Analytics Dashboard

**Confidential - For Planning Exercise Only**

---

## Your Role

You are the Technical Program Manager (TPM) for EventFlow. Your job is to bring data-driven insights to the roadmap planning discussion. You have access to EventFlow's analytics dashboard with customer behavior data, support ticket trends, and retention analysis.

**Your Goal:** Work with Sales and Engineering to select the optimal 5 features that fit within 100 story points and maximize ARR impact.

## Your Analytics Dashboard

**Access:** [DASHBOARD URL WILL BE PROVIDED]

The dashboard contains Q4 2025 through Q1 2026 data across 5 tabs:

1. **Overview** - High-level business metrics
2. **Registration Funnel** - Conversion rates by device
3. **Support Tickets** - Customer support volume by category
4. **Feature Usage & Retention** - Correlation between feature adoption and customer retention
5. **Customer Segments** - Breakdown by Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB

---

## Your Task

**Time: 5 minutes to explore**

Quickly review the dashboard and identify:
- What patterns or trends stand out?
- Are there any surprising correlations (e.g., between feature usage and retention)?
- Which customer pain points appear most frequently in support tickets?
- Where are we losing customers or revenue opportunities?

**You don't have time to analyze everything deeply - focus on the most striking patterns.**

---

## Discussion Phase (20 minutes)

After individual review, your team will discuss which 5 features to prioritize.

**Your role in the discussion:**
- Share data-driven insights from the analytics dashboard
- Challenge assumptions with quantitative evidence
- Ask questions like:
  - "How many customers does this feature actually serve?"
  - "What's the correlation between this capability and retention?"
  - "Do we have data showing this is a widespread issue or just a loud customer?"

**Remember:** Sales will have customer escalations and deal losses (loud noise). Engineering will have their pre-planned roadmap (technical perspective). Your job is to bring the quantitative data that might reveal different priorities.

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't just skim the Overview tab** - the interesting insights are deeper in the data
2. **Look for surprising patterns** - sometimes the biggest opportunities are in boring metrics
3. **Pay attention to scale** - is this a problem for 3 customers or 300?
4. **Check correlations** - what features correlate with retention and growth?
5. **Be ready to challenge urgency** - just because a customer is loud doesn't mean it's the biggest impact

## Instructions for the Simulation

1. **Explore the dashboard** (5 min) - Click through all 5 tabs, take notes on key findings

2. **Listen to your teammates** (5 min):
   - Engineering will present the feature catalog and their proposed roadmap
   - Sales will share customer escalations and competitive pressures

3. **Present your findings** (5 min) - Share the most important patterns you found in the data

4. **Debate and decide** (10 min) - Work with your team to select 5 features within 100 story points

5. **Fill out the worksheet** - Record your final feature selections

## What to Look For (Without Giving Away the Answer)

As you explore the dashboard, consider:

- **Volume vs. Impact:** Are the loudest customer requests actually the most common pain points?
- **Retention Drivers:** What do high-retention customers do differently than churned customers?
- **Hidden Bottlenecks:** Are there friction points in the customer journey that are easy to overlook?
- **Broad vs. Narrow:** Does this feature serve a small niche or a large segment of customers?

**Your data might contradict what Sales and Engineering think is urgent.** That's okay - your job is to bring evidence, even if it's uncomfortable.

---

## Reminder

This is a **collaborative exercise** - there's no "wrong" answer, but there is an optimal solution based on the data. Your goal is to work with Sales and Engineering to make the best decision you can with the information available.

Good luck!
